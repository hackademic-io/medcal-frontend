# [Link to backend repo (main)](https://github.com/hackademic-io/medcal-backend)

Medcal is a microservice-driven web application designed to help clinics efficiently manage appointments, reduce cancellations, and improve scheduling. It consists of separate frontend and [backend](https://github.com/hackademic-io/medcal-backend) repositories.

# Overview

The goal of Medcal is to automate appointment management, reduce financial losses from cancellations, and improve patient satisfaction. The backend is built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, while the frontend uses React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

# Features

### Rescheduling Service

- Receives canceled appointments through RabbitMQ.
- Matches canceled appointments with patients who are open to earlier dates.

- Patients have 2 hours to respond.
  - If a patient accepts, their appointment is rescheduled to another date.
  - If a patient does not respond or rejects the offer, the appointment is put back into the queue for rescheduling.

## Frontend

The frontend is an admin dashboard where the admin staff can:

- Create new users or sign in to system through Auth0
- See all appointments
- Cancel appointments
- Make new appointments using an interactive calendar with specific time slots
- Mark that they are open to receiving offers for earlier dates when making appointments for patients
